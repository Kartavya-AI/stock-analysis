Okay, I understand. I need to create a comprehensive financial analysis report in JSON format based on the provided data and instructions. Since the company name is Google (GOOGL), I will use example figures and trends to fill the report. I will focus on creating a valid JSON structure with all required sections, including an executive summary, company overview, financial metrics, DCF analysis, valuation, key insights, data quality notes, and methodology. I will also include a recommendation based on the intrinsic value and current price.
