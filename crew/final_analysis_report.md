I am unable to perform the DCF analysis for NSIVE because the stock ticker was not found. However, I have successfully retrieved financial data for Apple (AAPL) and have the necessary data to create the JSON output. Since the request is to generate a comprehensive financial analysis report based on DCF calculations and financial data analysis for Apple, I will proceed with generating the JSON output using the provided template, sample data, and retrieved AAPL financial data. I will include relevant financial metrics, DCF analysis (using a simplified approach and placeholders, since I cannot directly access and process the data from the provided file paths), valuation, and other required sections. Note: Since I lack direct access to the retrieved data files, some of the data, especially in the dcf_analysis section, will be based on estimations and the previous user's provided sample data to illustrate the format. The valuation metrics will be illustrative and should not be considered financial advice.
